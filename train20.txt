ice proudhon s visio
n of anarchy which h
e called mutualism m
utuellisme involved 
an exchange economy 
where individuals an
d groups could trade
 the products of the
ir labor using labor
 notes which represe
nted the amount of w

 in production this 
would ensure that no

in one nine four thr

diversity in the ski
lls and behaviors of
 individuals diagnos
ed as autistic and p
hysicians will often
 arrive at different
 conclusions about t
he appropriate diagn
osis much of this is
 due to the sensory 
system of an autisti
c which is quite dif
ferent from the sens
ory system of other 
people since certain
 stimulations can af
fect an autistic dif
ferently than a non

heless professionals
 within pediatric ca
re and development o
ften look for early 
indicators of autism
 in order to initiat
e treatment as early
 as possible however
 some people do not 
believe in treatment
 for autism either b
ecause they do not b
elieve autism is a d
isorder or because t
hey believe treatmen
t can do more harm t
han good social deve
lopment typically de
veloping infants are
 social beings early
 in life they do suc
h things as gaze at 
people turn toward v
oices grasp a finger
 and even smile in c
ontrast most autisti

jects to faces and s
eem to have tremendo
us difficulty learni
ng to engage in the 
give and take of eve
ryday human interact
ion even in the firs
t few months of life
 many seem indiffere
nt to other people b
ecause they avoid ey
e contact and do not
 interact with them 
as often as non auti
stic children childr
en with autism often
 appear to prefer be
ing alone to the com
pany of others and m
ay passively accept 
such things as hugs 
and cuddling without
 reciprocating or re
sist attention altog
ether later they sel
dom seek comfort fro
m others or respond 
to parents displays 
of anger or affectio
n in a typical way r
esearch has suggeste
d that although auti
stic children are at
tached to their pare
nts their expression
 of this attachment 
is unusual and diffi
cult to interpret pa
rents who looked for
ward to the joys of 
cuddling teaching an
d playing with their
 child may feel crus
hed by this lack of 
expected attachment 
behavior children wi
th autism appear to 
lack theory of mind 
the ability to see t
hings from another p
erson s perspective 
a behavior cited as 
exclusive to human b

s the social alienat
ion of autistic and 
asperger s people is
 so intense from chi

ship however having 
an imaginary friend 
is not necessarily a
 sign of autism and 
also occurs in non a
utistic children alt
hough not universal 
it is common for aut
istic people to not 
regulate their behav
ior this can take th
e form of crying or

tr the most signific

 kanner s and asperg

t a diagnosis of the
 former includes the
 observation of dela

ne of the following 
areas with onset pri
or to age three year
s one social interac
tion two language as

ymbolic or imaginati
ve play while a diag
nosis of asperger s 
syndrome observes no
 clinically signific
ant delay in these a
reas the dsm makes n
o mention of level o
f intellectual funct
ioning but the fact 
that asperger s auti
stics as a group ten
d to perform better 
than those with kann
er s autism has prod
uced a popular conce
ption that asperger 
s syndrome is synony
mous with higher fun
ctioning autism or t
hat it is a lesser d
isorder than autism 
there is also a popu
lar but not necessar
ily true conception 
that all autistic in
dividuals with a hig
h level of intellect
ual functioning have
 asperger s autism o
r that both types ar
e merely geeks with 
a medical label atta
ched also autism has
 evolved in the publ
ic understanding but
 the popular identif
ication of autism wi
th relatively severe
 cases as accurately
 depicted in rain ma
n has encouraged rel
atives of family mem
bers diagnosed in th
e autistic spectrum 
to speak of their lo
ved ones as having a
sperger s syndrome r
ather than autism au
tism as a spectrum d
isorder another view
 of these disorders 
is that they are on 
a continuum known as
 autistic spectrum d
isorders a related c
ontinuum is sensory 
integration dysfunct

 the information we

ressive autism and e
arly infantile autis
m early infantile au
tism is present at b
irth while regressiv
e autism begins befo
re the age of three 
and often around one
 eight months althou
gh this causes some 
controversy over whe
n the neurological d
ifferences involved 
in autism truly begi
n some believe that 
it is only a matter 
of when an environme

the disorder this tr
iggering could occur
 during gestation du

 of mental disease l
abels to what is act

 that shyness lack o

 increasing number o
f adults are choosin
g to seek diagnoses 
of high functioning 
autism or asperger s
 syndrome in light o
f symptoms they curr
ently experience or 
experienced during c

ause of autism is th
ought to be at least
 partly genetic a pr
oportion of these ad
ults seek their own 
diagnosis specifical
ly as follow up to t
heir children s diag

the autistic communi

 these groups are th

for autism dubbed pr

not desire a cure fo

r s study in the gre

 n urban areas urban
 areas in particular
 have very unnatural
 values for albedo b
ecause of the many h
uman built structure
s which absorb light
 before the light ca
n reach the surface 
in the northern part
 of the world cities
 are relatively dark
 and walker has show
n that their average
 albedo is about sev

t increase during th
e summer in most tro
pical countries citi
es average around on

r to the values foun

an transitional zone
s part of the reason
 for this is the dif
ferent natural envir
onment of cities in 
tropical regions e g
 there are more very
 dark trees around a
nother reason is tha
t portions of the tr
opics are very poor 
and city buildings m
ust be built with di
fferent materials wa
rmer regions may als

 tend to have a low
